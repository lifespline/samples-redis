RediSearch is a full-text search engine that features document storage within Redis while enabling high-performance search capabilities. RediSearch 2.0 enables real-tim  secondary indexing and powerful querying to create a full-text search engine. The RediSearch module enables weighted search results, the use of Boolean logic, autocomplete functionality, and several other common features. The use of fuzzy-logic search technology helps to enhance search results for users, especially when combined with autocomplete suggestions. RediSearch can also perform concurrent queries and concurrent indexing, which further enhances performance.
