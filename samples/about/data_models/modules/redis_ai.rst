=======

RedisAI is a Redis module for executing Deep Learning/Machine Learning models and managing their data. RedisAI uses tensors as a means for modeling machines and deep-learning problems. Some common use cases for the RedisAI module include speech recognition and natural language processing, object detection and visual inspection, and filtering of extremely scaled data, such as social network data.
