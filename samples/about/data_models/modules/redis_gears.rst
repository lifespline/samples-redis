==========

RedisGears is an engine for data processing in Redis. RedisGears supports batch and event-driven processing for Redis data. To use RedisGears, you write functions that describe how your data should be processed. You then submit this code to your Redis deployment for remote execution. RedisGears provides a means to execute Python functions and entire Python scripts inside of Redis. Executing functions and scripts not only speeds up processing but also simplifies architecture, enabling serverless architectures.
