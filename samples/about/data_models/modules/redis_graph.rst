RedisGraph is a module that implements a graph database within Redis. Graph databases provide a method for implementation of graph theory through data. A common example when discussing graph database use cases revolves around identifying relationships between social media users. With a graph database, each endpoint or node can have zero or more properties. Nodes are then connected to each other through an edge. Like nodes, edges can also have properties of their own.
