Problem Statement
-----------------

We're trying to solve the following problems which seem to be related:

.. _track_todo:

Tracking TODO tasks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Sometimes I forget to track tasks and I'm only reminded wither when it's too late, or when there are already consequences to my negligence, say fines with interest. The knowledge that I may be forgetting something is always with me and it generates permanently an unconfortable level of anxiety, or it hinders a feeling of safety from settling in.*

.. _task_context:

Understanding the need/the context for each task
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Sometimes I'm working on something and I can't precise exactly why I'm working on it. That unawareness makes the process of completing the task much less productive for many reasons, one of them being that I may go into too much detail, because I have lost the awareness of the actual requirements for the task.*

.. _prioritize_tasks:

Prioritize tasks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Mostly I tend to work on the tasks that give me great pleasure and continuously postpone working on tasks that don't give as much joy, chores like paying taxes, etc.- I believe because I lack the context on why to execute those tasks. But it would be great to know which tasks need to be completed when, or which ones are more important - by some objective measurement - so I could better navigate the backlog or the tasks I feel like working on.*

.. _track_task_progress:

Track progress of tasks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Sometimes I'm rather clueless on the progress of a task because I began working on sub tasks, etc. It would be great to get a measurement of how much a task is closed to become completed, evaluating from its subtasks.*

Solution and Behaviour Analysis
-------------------------------

A network graph with nodes representing tasks and edges representing to which tasks a task relates to, should:

* provide a way to :ref:`track the TODO tasks <track_todo>` by having nodes persisted and representing the tasks;
* it should provide a way to :ref:`understanding the context of each task <task_context>` by displaying the edges between nodes (recursively, it will show how that task is contributing to something the agent can relate to primarily);
* it should provide a way to :ref:`prioritize tasks <prioritize_tasks>` by checking the timeline for each node;
* it should provide a way to :ref:`track the progress of tasks <track_task_progress>` by seeing how many child tasks/nodes have been finished;

.. _track_todo_behaviour:

Tracking TODO tasks :ref:`doc <track_todo>`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To enable the tracking of TODO tasks, it should be possible to perform the following actions on the nodes:

.. _BS1:

BEHAVIOUR 1: SPEC

    Add new node (nodes don't necessarily need to have a parent just yet) with a template for:

    * ``title``: the title of the task
    * ``content``: a description of the task
    * ``acceptance-criteria``: the criteria for the task to be considered completed
    * ``dor-definition-of-ready``: what must be in place for the task to be ready to be worked on
    * ``list-of-parents``: the tasks this task is related to, or the tasks this task helps accomplishing
    * ``list-of-children``: the tasks related to this, or the tasks that help accomplishing this task

.. image:: ../static/img/BS1.png
    :width: 400
    :alt: Behaviour 1: SPEC

BEHAVIOUR 1: TEST SPEC

    * ``title``: verify that the title of the task is persisted
    * ``content``: verify that the content of the task is persisted
    * ``acceptance-criteria``: verify that the acceptance criteria of the task is persisted
    * ``dor-definition-of-ready``: verify that the DOR of the task is persisted
    * ``list-of-parents``: verify that the list of parents of the task is persisted
    * ``list-of-children``: verify that the list of children of the task is persisted

.. _BS2:

BEHAVIOUR 2: SPEC

    Edit node properties

    * ``title``
    * ``content``
    * ``acceptance-criteria``
    * ``dor-definition-of-ready``

.. image:: ../static/img/BS2.png
    :width: 400
    :alt: Behaviour 2: SPEC

BEHAVIOUR 2: TEST SPEC

    * ``title``: verify that the edited title of the task is persisted
    * ``content``: verify that the edited content of the task is persisted
    * ``acceptance-criteria``: verify that the edited acceptance criteria of the task is persisted
    * ``dor-definition-of-ready``: verify that the edited DOR of the task is persisted

.. _BS3:

BEHAVIOUR 3: SPEC

    Remove node from backlog network graph. It is OK at this point to wipe it entirely and not be able to recover it. Make all the child nodes orphan.

.. image:: ../static/img/BS3.png
    :width: 400
    :alt: Behaviour 3: SPEC

BEHAVIOUR 3: TEST SPEC

    * verify that the node was removed
    * verify that the node's children are now orphans
    * verify that the node's children haven't lost any nodes

.. _BS4:

BEHAVIOUR 4: SPEC

    Have intuitive visualization of the backlog nodes.

.. image:: ../static/img/tasks-network-graph.png
    :width: 400
    :alt: Intuitive visualization of the backlog nodes

BEHAVIOUR 4: TEST SPEC

    * verify that the chosen visualization renders successfully
    * vefify that the chosen visualization is intuitive

.. _task_context_behaviour:

Understanding the need/the context for each task :ref:`doc <task_context>`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a **first set of primary nodes** representing **what the agent likes/wants to do with his life**. All subsequent nodes should derive from these, or from a child of these - recursively.

BEHAVIOUR 5: SPEC

    Items derive from:

    * ``creativity``
    * ``passion``
    * ``performance``
    * ``power``

    Discarded items derive from:

    * ``physical-stimuli``
    * ``memory``: past reality
    * ``imagination``: alternate reality
    * ``emotion``: strong physical sensation prompting action (fear, anger, etc.)
    * ``thought``: new perspective on reality, typically a solution or hint
    * ``speculation``: a speculation on the cause/consequences of an event that happened in reality
    * ``willingness``: a willingness prompting action
    * ``opportunity``: opportunity to decrease the work required to accomplish a task
    * ``unknown``: any other categorie

    These items should be made available in the network from the start. All new items should fit into one of these categories. Otherwise, it should be possible to add a new primary node.

.. image:: ../static/img/BS5.png
    :width: 400
    :alt: Behaviour 5: SPEC

BEHAVIOUR 5: TEST SPEC

    All these nodes need to be available in the network from the start:

    * ``creativity``
    * ``passion``
    * ``performance``
    * ``power``
    * ``physical-stimuli``
    * ``memory``
    * ``imagination``
    * ``emotion``
    * ``thought``
    * ``speculation``
    * ``willingness``
    * ``opportunity``
    * ``unknown``

.. _prioritize_tasks_behaviour:

Prioritize tasks :ref:`doc <prioritize_tasks>`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

BEHAVIOUR 6: SPEC

    Each node should have the following properties:

    * ``due-date``: the date the task is due to be completed
    * ``priority``: a value that should help with prioritization. It is to be discussed what this value varies in function of. *E.g.*: In the working context, it varies based on the customer needs, meaning the customer decides the prioritization.

.. image:: ../static/img/BS6.png
    :width: 400
    :alt: Behaviour 6: SPEC

BEHAVIOUR 6: TEST SPEC

    * ``due-date``: the due date should be persisted
    * ``due-date``: the due date should be editable
    * ``priority``: the priority should be persisted
    * ``priority``: the priority should be editable

.. _track_task_progress_behaviour:

Track progress of tasks :ref:`doc <track_task_progress>`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

BEHAVIOUR 7: SPEC

    Each node should have the following properties:

    * ``focus-toggle``: a toggle to indicate whether the task is being engaged with or not. A task can be engaged with either from ``analysis`` or from what the task requires to be completed.

    Only one task can be engaged with at a time. The previous engaged task becomes unengaged if a new one is engaged with.

    A time counter initiates when a task is engaged with and it stops when the task is not engaged with. There's an accumulator variable holding the total time of focus time.
    * ``focus-type``: the type of focus the task is being engaged with. It can be either ``analysis`` or ``execution``. ``analysis`` means the task is being analyzed before being executed. It can be interesting to understand how much time goes into understanding a problem and how much goes into solving it.

.. image:: ../static/img/BS7.png
    :width: 400
    :alt: Behaviour 7: SPEC

BEHAVIOUR 7: TEST SPEC

    Each node should have the following properties:

    * verify that the ``focus-type==analysis`` saves the time spent in the accumulator variable ``focus_type_analysis``
    * verify that the ``focus-type==execution`` saves the time spent in the accumulator variable ``focus_type_execution``
    * verify that the ``focus-toggle`` stops and restarts the counter.
    * verify that the ``focus-toggle`` the accumulator persists the total time of focus time.
    * verify that the ``focus-toggle`` stops the focus toggle on a different task and that that different task focus time accumulator is duly updated.

BEHAVIOUR 8: SPEC

    All tasks are actionable tasks because all tasks can at least be ``analysed``. It may be interesting to know:
    * ``number-of-subtasks``: the total number of child tasks
    * ``number-of-leaves``: the total number of child tasks that are leaves

.. image:: ../static/img/BS8.png
    :width: 400
    :alt: Behaviour 8: SPEC

BEHAVIOUR 8: TEST SPEC

    Each node should have the following properties:

    * verify that the ``number-of-subtasks`` is correct
    * verify that the ``number-of-subtasks`` is correct after a task is removed
    * verify that the ``number-of-leaves`` is correct
    * verify that the ``number-of-leaves`` is correct after a task is removed

BEHAVIOUR 9: SPEC

    The ``total-time-spent-on-subtasks`` provides a metric that can help understanding **how much work has been put into this task**. It is still uncertain how this help understanding the progress of the task, but it is a good start. The ``total-time-spent-on-subtasks`` refers either to:

    * the task itself;
    * or to the total sum of the tree taking the task as root;
    * or to the total sum of the leaves of the tree taking the task as root;

    * ``total-time-spent-on-task==analysis``: the total time spent on the task analyzing
    * ``total-time-spent-on-task==execution``: the total time spent on the task executing
    * ``total-time-spent-on-task``: the total time spent on the task
    * ``total-time-spent-on-subtasks==analysis``: the total time spent on all tasks analyzing
    * ``total-time-spent-on-subtasks==execution``: the total time spent on all tasks executing
    * ``total-time-spent-on-subtasks``: the total time spent on all tasks
    * ``total-time-spent-on-leaves==analysis``: the total time spent on all leaves analyzing
    * ``total-time-spent-on-leaves==execution``: the total time spent on all leaves executing
    * ``total-time-spent-on-leaves``: the total time spent on all leaves

.. image:: ../static/img/BS9.png

BEHAVIOUR 9: TEST SPEC

    Each node should have the following properties:

    * verify that ``total-time-spent-on-task==analysis`` is correct

    * verify that ``total-time-spent-on-leaves==analysis`` is updated after removing any leave
    * verify that ``total-time-spent-on-leaves==execution`` is updated after removing any leave
    * verify that ``total-time-spent-on-leaves`` is updated after removing any leave

Solution Extra behaviours
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To each node:

* ``attached-files``: Any attached files to the node, typically related to the node content, like images, diagrams, etc.
* ``estimated-effort``: How much work this task is expected to require. It is required to come up with an unit for ``work``.
* ``date-of-creation``: the date of creation of the node
* ``date-of-completion``: the date of completion of the node
* edit:
    * ``list-of-parents``
    * ``list-of-children``
* get repo of parent node (if any) as to know from which branch to branch
* on removing node, decide what to do with the child nodes.
* ``focus-toggle``: depends on user commitment for now, but it can be endlessly automated, this will be a roll-over feature, the more automated, the more effective. See the *pomodoro technique*.
